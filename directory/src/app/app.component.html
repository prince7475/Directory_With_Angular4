<!-- Custom Property binding @input -->
<!-- We give it a custom name, in this case we called it kellem and gave it a value of kellem -->
<!-- The value given is in our app.component.ts -->
<!-- Next: go to home.component.ts to see how we receive our component -->

<!-- step 1: -->
<!-- @output, now we want to send data up from home component to the app component -->
<!-- onYell is the function we are listening for in the home component -->
<!-- Once that funtion is fired we will run a function on app.component.ts called yell (lower cased)  and pass down the event given by the home component-->

<!-- next steps: go to the app.components.ts to look at the yell function -->
<!-- <app-home [kellem]="kellem" (onYell)="yell($event)">Hello there</app-home> -->
